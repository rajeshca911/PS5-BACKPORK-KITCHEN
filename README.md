# PS5-BACKPORK-KITCHEN

Simplify your PS5 homebrew workflow with **PS5 BackPork Kitchen** — a practical backporting utility that bridges the gap between modern game binaries and lower firmware versions.
This tool builds upon the existing PS5 backporting concept and scripts used in the community, providing a GUI-based and automated workflow for convenience.



## Features

- 📦 Automatic Backup System
- 🖥️ GUI-Based Workflow
